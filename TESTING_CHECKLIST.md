# Mind Map Testing Checklist

## ‚úÖ Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Connection Creation Between Existing Nodes
- [x] Fixed `document.elementFromPoint` interference by temporarily hiding drag line
- [x] Added proper hit detection for target nodes
- [x] Verified connection creation works with both left-click on outer ring and middle-click anywhere on node
- [x] Added visual feedback (green highlighting) for target nodes during drag

**Test Steps:**
1. Create two nodes
2. Middle-click on first node and drag to second node
3. Verify connection is created between the nodes
4. Test left-click on outer ring of node and drag to another node
5. Verify connection is created

### 2. Properties Panel Disappearing Issue
- [x] Fixed canvas click handler preventing clearSelection on node clicks
- [x] Added proper element detection to distinguish between node clicks and canvas clicks
- [x] Removed debug logs that were causing stack traces
- [x] Panel now stays open when clicking on nodes

**Test Steps:**
1. Click on any node
2. Verify properties panel opens and stays open
3. Click on canvas (empty area)
4. Verify properties panel closes
5. Click on different node
6. Verify properties panel updates to show new node's properties

## ‚úÖ Code Architecture Improvements

### 3. Modular Core System
- [x] Created `BaseManager` class for consistent manager inheritance
- [x] Created `EventEmitter` for standardized event handling
- [x] Created `Utils` module with common utility functions
- [x] Created `ConfigManager` for centralized configuration
- [x] Created `ErrorHandler` for production-ready error management

**Modules Created:**
- `core/base-manager.js` - Base class for all managers
- `core/event-emitter.js` - Event handling system
- `core/utils.js` - Utility functions
- `core/config-manager.js` - Configuration management
- `core/error-handler.js` - Error handling and user notifications

### 4. Production Best Practices
- [x] Added comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- [x] Created modular architecture with proper separation of concerns
- [x] Added configuration management with validation
- [x] Implemented proper logging levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- [x] Added error dialog system with proper UI
- [x] Cleaned up debug logs and console output

## üß™ Functional Testing

### Node Operations
- [ ] **Create Node**: Click "Add Node" button creates new node
- [ ] **Select Node**: Click on node selects it and opens properties panel
- [ ] **Move Node**: Drag node to move it (with proper drag threshold)
- [ ] **Edit Node**: Double-click node to edit text
- [ ] **Delete Node**: Select node and press Delete key
- [ ] **Node Properties**: All property panel controls work (shape, color, text, etc.)

### Connection Operations
- [ ] **Create Connection**: Middle-click and drag between nodes creates connection
- [ ] **Create Connection (Outer Ring)**: Left-click outer ring and drag creates connection
- [ ] **Create Node + Connection**: Drag to empty space creates new node with connection
- [ ] **Select Connection**: Click on connection selects it
- [ ] **Delete Connection**: Ctrl+click connection to delete
- [ ] **Control Points**: Click connection to add control points
- [ ] **Move Control Points**: Drag control points to reshape connections
- [ ] **Delete Control Points**: Click control points to delete them

### Panel Operations
- [ ] **Open Panel**: Clicking node opens properties panel
- [ ] **Panel Persistence**: Panel stays open after node selection
