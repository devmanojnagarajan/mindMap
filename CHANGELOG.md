## Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Chosen for simplicity and performance
- **SVG Graphics**: Provides crisp visuals and easy manipulation
- **Manager Pattern**: Modular architecture for maintainability
- **Event-Driven**: Loose coupling between components

### Performance Considerations
- **Debounced Operations**: Prevents excessive history entries
- **Efficient Rendering**: Minimizes DOM manipulations
